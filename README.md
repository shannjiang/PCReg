# PCReg

PCReg is user-friendly one-command-line python scripts which can perform linear or non-linear dimensionality reduction and perform principle component regression based on these principle components reduced from the linear or non-linear dimensionality reduction. PCReg includes two statistical models for the current version, linear regression and logistic regression. You need to choose the correct model depending on the data type of the response variable (linear regression if the response variable is continuous and logistic regression if the response variable is binary).

PCReg is compiled in Python 3. Please type the following command in your terminal if you have not installed one or some of these python module(s) in python 3:

*pip3 install pandas statistics numpy random sklearn scipy statsmodels argparse warnings*
